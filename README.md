class _SampleScreenState extends State<SampleScreen> {
  /// Initialize the controller for Intl Text editing
  final _phoneNumberController = IntlTextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

          title: Text('NsIntlPhoneInput Example',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge),
        ),
        body: Center(
          /// Assign it to NsIntlPhoneInput widget
          child: NsIntlPhoneInput(
            textEditingController: _phoneNumberController,
            onPhoneChange: (countrySelection) {
              print(countrySelection);
