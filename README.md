          title: Text('NsIntlPhoneInput Example',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge),
        ),
        body: Center(
          /// Assign it to NsIntlPhoneInput widget
          child: NsIntlPhoneInput(
            textEditingController: _phoneNumberController,
            onPhoneChange: (countrySelection) {
              print(countrySelection);
